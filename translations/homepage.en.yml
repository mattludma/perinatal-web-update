    title: About the project
    text: Few people talk openly about the difficult moments in women's lives during the perinatal period. The perinatal period from a psychological perspective includes the time from the beginning of pregnancy to one year of the child. It is during this time that parents may be exposed to psychosocial stress that also affects their child. Then, when psychological difficulties come unexpectedly, it is easy to get the impression that we are the only ones in the world who cannot cope. But this is a false impression.

    text: Our goal is to raise awareness of psychological difficulties in women in the perinatal period. We also want to bring a tested model of accessible care for women who have been betrayed by their psyche during pregnancy or after childbirth. The aim is also to prevent the negative effects of psychosocial stress on their children.

    title: Vision
    text: In the Czech Republic there is a system of early detection of women who are at risk of psychosocial stress in the perinatal period. Stepped mental health care is also offered to interested women. The issue of perinatal mental health is widespread, both among women themselves and among obstetricians, midwives and psychiatrists in the country. There are a minimum of children in the country who are negatively affected by psychosocial stress in their parents from a young age.
